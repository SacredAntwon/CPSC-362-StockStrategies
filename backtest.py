The common metrics used for backtesting include:
annualized  return  (yearly  average  %  profit  or  loss  from  the  strategy),
%  profitability  (%  of  total trades that resulted in profits),
Win/Loss ratio (sum_of_profit/sum_of_loss),
Max drawdown (the largest drop in profit and loss calculated by [trough_value â€“ peak_value]/peak_value),
annualized volatility  (the  standard  deviation  of  daily  return  in  a  year),
Sharpe  Ratio  (the  reward/risk  ratio, calculated by an annualized return / annualized volatility)
